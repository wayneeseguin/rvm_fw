%h2 What is RVM?

%p 
  RVM stands for "Ruby Version Manager" and can be found online at: 
  %a{:href=>'http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/'} http://rvm.beginrescueend.com
%p In short, RVM allows you to install and manage multiple Ruby versions side by side on the same system easily. It also provides a means to install "gemsets" allowing you to group your gems together by application, Rails version, etc.

%h2 What is RVM::FW (Firewall)?

%p 
  RVM::FW is a simple Sinatra application that runs on a Phusion enabled webserver (but the config.ru can be easily modified for Mongrel, Thin, etc. to fit your needs).  This index page provides a brief explanation of how to use RVM in case you can't access the main RVM page and also explains how to replace your ~/.rvm/config/db file with the dynamically generated db file from RVM:FW which lists _only_ the available Ruby installs in this application.

%h2 What inspired RVM::FW?

%p
  Many corporate environments restrict access to the outside web in order to limit the risk of downloading viruses or causing damage throughout the network unintentionally.  A lot of these places require special permission to download and install software.  I work in one of these places, but I still wanted to be able to use the same RVM setup I have at home at work (where I need it the most!)  In turn I dug around and decided the easiest way to use RVM without outside internet access was modifying RVM's ~/.rvm/config/db file to point to an internal website that had many of the same Ruby versions readily available to install.

%h2 How do I use RVM::FW Rubies?

%p
  This is the easiest part.  Once you've installed RVM::FW and have it running on a publicly accessible webserver merely download the
  %a{:href => '/db'} customized database file
  and save it as ~/.rvm/config/user.  This will override the default config settings and enable you to install any of the available Rubies within RVM::FW the same way you would at home.
